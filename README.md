This program is a Python script that uses the SymPy library to solve various types of mathematical problems. The program starts by importing necessary functions from SymPy, including symbols, equations, integrals, derivatives, matrices, and plotting. It then defines a function called solve_problem that takes a string as input representing a mathematical problem and returns the solution(s) to that problem.

The solve_problem function first checks the type of problem by looking for certain keywords in the input string. If the problem is an equation, it parses the left and right sides of the equation using the SymPy parser and then solves for the variable x. If the problem is a system of equations, it parses each equation using the parser, identifies the variables involved, and then solves the system of equations. If the problem is a polynomial equation, it parses the equation and then finds the roots of the polynomial using the SymPy roots function.

If the problem is not an equation or polynomial, the function first parses the input string into a SymPy expression using the parser. It then checks the type of expression and solves the problem accordingly. If the expression is an equation, it solves for the variable x. If the expression is an integral, it solves the integral. If the expression is a derivative, it solves the derivative. If the expression is a matrix, it performs the corresponding matrix operation. Finally, if the expression is not one of the above types, it simplifies the expression using the SymPy simplify function.

The solve_problem function also includes additional functionality for certain types of problems. If the input string contains sin or cos, it solves the equation using SymPy's solveset function. If the input string contains tan, it replaces the tan function with the SymPy tan function and then evaluates the result numerically. If the input string contains limit, it parses the expression, identifies the variable and limit point, and then evaluates the limit using SymPy's limit function. If the input string contains second derivative, it parses the expression, identifies the variable, and then evaluates the second derivative using SymPy's diff function. If the input string contains heat equation, it defines the heat equation and then uses SymPy's pde.pdsolve function to solve it. If the input string contains plot, it parses the expression and then plots the resulting function using SymPy's plot function. Finally, if the input string contains numeric, it parses the expression, converts it to a lambda function, and then evaluates the function numerically over a specified range using the lambdify and plot functions.

The program also includes a main loop that repeatedly prompts the user to enter a mathematical problem, tries to solve the problem using the solve_problem function, and then displays the result to the user. If the same problem is entered multiple times, the program looks up the solution in a dictionary called prev_problems and displays the previously computed solution instead of solving the problem again. If the solve_problem function encounters an error while trying to solve the problem, it catches the error and prints an error message to the user.

Note: It is important to make sure that you have the required libraries installed before running the program. In this case, you need the SymPy library installed. If you do not have it installed, you can install it by running pip install sympy in your command prompt or terminal.

here are some examples of equations you can solve with the program, along with how to enter them:

    Solve the equation x + 2 = 5:
        Enter: "x + 2 = 5"

    Solve the system of equations x + y = 4, 2x + y = 7:
        Enter: "system: x + y = 4, 2*x + y = 7"

    Find the roots of the polynomial x^2 + 5x + 6:
        Enter: "polynomial: x**2 + 5*x + 6"

    Evaluate the integral of x^2 with respect to x:
        Enter: "integral of x**2 dx"

    Find the derivative of y = x^3 with respect to x:
        Enter: "derivative of x**3 with respect to x"

    Solve the matrix equation [1 2; 3 4] * [x; y] = [5; 11]:

    Evaluate the limit of (x^2 - 4) / (x - 2) as x approaches 2:
        Enter: "limit of (x**2 - 4)/(x - 2), x, 2"

    Find the second derivative of y = x^3 - 2x + 1:
        Enter: "second derivative of x**3 - 2*x + 1"

    Solve the heat equation u_xx + u_yy = 0:
        Enter: "heat equation"

These are just a few examples, and the program is capable of solving many other types of problems as well.
